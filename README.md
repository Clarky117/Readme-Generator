## Description

In week 9 of the UWA coding bootcamp we have been tasked with creating a readme generator that we could use for future assignments. With my previous assignments, and even the group project, I have fallen into my own pattern of the type of readme I create. I wouldn't mind feedback whether I should use the new format we have been provided, or at this point in time with the assignments we are doing, if my current format is okay. I'll do whatver nets me the highest possible grade.

## Key Points

As stated above, when creating a new project out there in the big wide world of web developement, it is pivotal to gain skills that increase our time management. One such example is the ability to create a command line application that can ask you a few simple questions and then auto populate and generate you a usable file.

## Skills Used

In this assignment we have learnt all about node.js and what it means to run javascript outside of the browser.

After installing node.js on our computers we have learnt to identify what particular packages we need to import to suit our needs, in this case we are given started code, however had we not, the first steps would be to run npm init from our terminal. This creates a package.json file that asks us a few simple questions, much like this submitted assignment. 

Once that has been set up, we can now import inquirer, as that gives us the ability to ask questions via .prompt, and to return a promise with .then.

With the help and extra guidance of Sam, i have imported 2 more packages. FS allows us to write the file, and Path allows us to set the output path that will work on all operating systems, so if written for example on Windows, it will have no issues running on Mac or Linux.

## Readme Visual

## Things i want to work on

I would like to familiarise myself more with the versatility of running Javascript outside the browser and what its full capabilities are with all the packages that exist out there. This assignment was really enjoyable and i can see how utilising things such as node can be a real tool in a developers belt.
