## Description

Readme generator that runs on the command line, asks you a few simple questions and then auto populates and generates you a usable file.

## Skills Used

In this assignment we have learnt all about node.js and what it means to run javascript outside of the browser.

After installing node.js on our computers we have learnt to identify what particular packages we need to import to suit our needs, in this case we are given started code, however had we not, the first steps would be to run npm init from our terminal. This creates a package.json file that asks us a few simple questions, much like this submitted assignment. 

Once that has been set up, we can now import inquirer, as that gives us the ability to ask questions via .prompt, and to return a promise with .then.

With the help and extra guidance of Sam, i have imported 2 more packages. FS allows us to write the file, and Path allows us to set the output path that will work on all operating systems, so if written for example on Windows, it will have no issues running on Mac or Linux.

## Things i want to work on

I would like to familiarise myself more with the versatility of running Javascript outside the browser and what its full capabilities are with all the packages that exist out there. This assignment was really enjoyable and i can see how utilising things such as node can be a real tool in a developers belt.
